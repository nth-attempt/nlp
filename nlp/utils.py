    Given a variable of shape `(batch_size,)` that represents the sequence lengths of each batch
    element, this function returns a `(batch_size, max_length)` mask variable.  For example, if
    our input was `[2, 2, 3]`, with a `max_length` of 4, we'd return
    `[[1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0]]`.
    We require `max_length` here instead of just computing it from the input `sequence_lengths`
    because it lets us avoid finding the max, then copying that value from the GPU to the CPU so
    that we can use it to construct a new tensor.
